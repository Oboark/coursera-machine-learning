Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):
A GAN has 2 networks, a discriminator network and a generative network.
The generative network is fed random noise and generates (let's say) an image from the noise.
The discriminator network guesses if the image is real or fake, here it returns an error.
Based on that error, the generative network improves itself. (If the error is high, it's not realistic enough and vice versa)

We give the discriminator a real iamge, get it's error
Then we generate a fake image, give the discriminator that.
So it alternates between real then fake then real then fake then so on.
It's a cycle.

The discriminator constantly improves itself on the generator and 
the generator constantly improves itself on the discrimator. 
Eventually the generator will create such good images that the discriminator 
is going to output 0.5, it's literally 50/50 or indistiguishable.

We use the gradient of the discriminator, to train the generator.

The generator is trying to make the error of the discriminator higher
and the discriminator is trying to make it's own error less.
It's like a competition.

A lot of networks do this, it's called adversarial training where 2 networks 
fight over the value of a number.
